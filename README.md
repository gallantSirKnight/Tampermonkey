This repository contains Tampermonkey scripts I have made that are open for anyone to use.

Twitch Ticker:
This script enables a live feed news ticker at the top of non-streaming pages on Twitch.tv highlighting currently popular and trending livestreams, beneficial if you don't know what to watch or want to look out for events!

Roblox Gems:
Designed to act as a 'game roulette', this script adds a button to the sidebar on Roblox.com which looks to find lesser played, but still playable games which is a helpful tool after Roblox has locked a large quantity of older or non-updated games.
